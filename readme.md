Collections

In the workarea, create a folder (we’ll set this up for you so you won’t need to do this for launch) 
New >Create collection
Add product lists
Reorder them.
Hit update
Go to the main collections folder in collections to get the ID. You’ll put this ID in the widget.

Meanwhile, back at in the widget,
Once you enter your collection, you’ll see the list and the order that’s displayed. This is important.
Then you want to make sure the list style is set to TabbedCarouselView and set the Header Text. You need to set this because it’s not pulling in a list title or the collection name. 
Once you’ve done that, you’ll have to enter the tab text in the Tabbed Carousel View Options tab names field. 
Here’s where you need to pay close attention to the order of your list. You’ll enter the names that will go on the tabs in the order of the lists, separating each tab name by a comma. 
It’s important to note, that we won’t easily be able to have a tab name with a comma in it as a result. So think of an alternative to Lions, Tigers & Bears. It won’t work. 

ALSO each list must have a view all or the carousels jump around and we hate that. 

Hit save, triple check that your tabs look good and actually correspond with the products in their respective carousels. 
Then get a friend to check it too.
